== Sysdig OPA Image Scanner on OpenShift 4.5.2+

----
The Sysdig OPA Image Scanner registers as a dynamic admission controller plugin and intercepts 
the creation, or update of Pods, in the cluster. 

When a Pod resource is intercepted, the controller performs several steps for every container inside the pod:

It triggers a scan of the image used for that container.

It modifies (mutates) the pod definition by changing the tag of the image and replacing it with the @sha256:digest, 
so the image is selected by digest and not by tag.

It retrieves the scan report of the image.

It evaluates the scan report and the admission review context using a set of OPA rules that can be modified and extended if required.
